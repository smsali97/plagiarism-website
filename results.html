<body> <h1> Result of Student and Journalist Plagiarism</h1>
<br>
<p> In academics, plagiarism is a punishable and a very severe crime. <img src="police.jpg" width="268" height="330" align="right" /></p>
<p>  In middle schools and high schools, it is penalized less severely; students seldom get punished more than a failing grade on that particular project. However, on the college and university levels, they may fail in their entire course, when caught for plagiarism. However, in cases of repeated or very severe plagiarism, students may be suspended and/or expelled from the school or college. Many colleges (especially law schools) even go as far as to confiscate or annul the plagiarizer’s academic awards and degrees which he/she got from the plagiarized work. The Department of Education of England has invented a tax for plagiarism on higher secondary level. <br>
  In America, the “Highline Community College Student Rights and Responsibilities” section of the “Washington Administrative Code (WAC)”specifies punishments of plagiarism. If the student is caught plagiarizing and he/she accepts it, the examiner can either: make the student repeat the assignment, lower the assignment’s marks or grade, or refuse to accept the assignment. If the student is caught plagiarizing, and he/she refuses to accept it, the student can be penalized by either: being put on probation (trial), suspended from the school, or expelled from the school.<br>
In the world of journalism, plagiarism is a violation of the journalist ethics set by the International Journalist Convention 2003. It is punishable by penalties as great as and including termination of employment. While journalist plagiarism is as old as journalism, the recent development of the Internet has multiplied this process tenfold.</p>
