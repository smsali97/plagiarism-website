  <p>THE HISTORY OF PLAGIARISM </p></center>
</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>It all started with poetry and Romans...<img src="blah!.jpg" width="187" height="149" align="middle" /></h2>
<p>No really it did, believe it or not, plagiarism is as old as the 1st Century. In the 1st Century A Roman poet named Martial had found another poet &quot;kidnapping his verses&quot; . At that time this plagiarism was referred as   <em>as &quot;plagiarius&quot;</em> as in literal kidnapper. I know, right?</p>
<p> Then, in the 1600s a dramatist Ben Johnson introduced this word in English, describing it as <em>plagiary (someone guilty of theft).</em></p>
<p>However the real form of plagiarism started in the 18th Century during the Romantic Movement in Europe. It was during this &quot;Romantic&quot; period, when the free will of copying/borrowing someone's work was banned. So, no sculpture, art, music couldn't be copied at free will anymore. </p>

<p> <strong>Mind you, this was the time of Shakespeare..so can you imagine if someone copied Shakespeare?? They would at least be a thousand Shakespeares to this day?!!!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then later in 1755, Johnson's   famous dictionary has introduced the word plagiary.</p>
<p>It stated and I quote, &quot;One that imitates; a plagiary; an imitator. Without invention a painter is but aÂ <em>copier</em>, and a poet but a plagiary of others.&quot; </p>
<p>And till then...this plagiarism is being used till the 21st century..So thats how plagiarism actually &quot;came into being&quot;...</p>
