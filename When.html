  <li>we don't know we actually are plagiarising. This is the most occured case, we usually copy/paste our work without knowing that we are actually &quot;stealing&quot; someone else's work</li>
  <li>we we need a better form of answers or information, as our answers/reports are of mediocre level and lacks solid points and experience.</li>
  <li>to take someone else's efforts and show them as our own, usually for reasons like popularity and fams <center> <img src="banana.jpg" width="576" height="403" /> </center> </li>
