<p>A turtle?  </p>
<p><img src="turtlejpg.jpg" width="229" height="132" /></p>
<p>What?! NO!!  </p>
<p>We will look into this question in detail…  </p> 
<h1> What actually is plagiarism?</h1>
<p>Most people think of plagiarism as the replication of someone else’s work, or the borrowing of another’s work. However, the real meaning of this criminal term is quite worse.<br>
</p>
<p>According to “www.tfd.com”, plagiarism is, “The verbatim copying or imitation of the language, ideas, or thoughts of another author and representing them as one’s own original work.”</p>
<p>Basically, plagiarism is a form of deception. It means stealing another’s ideas and being untruthful about it.<br>
</p>
<h3>Plagiarism includes: </h3><br>
<ul><li>turning in another’s work and calling it your own</li><br>
<li>replicating another’s ideas without citing the source</li><br>
<li>not  putting a quote in speech marks</li><br>
<li>citing the false source of a quote</li><br>
<li>changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit</li><br>
<li>replicating such a large part of another’s work that it contributes to majority of your work; whether you provide citations or you do not. </li>
</ul>
