<br>
<p>Plagiarism is a very serious and severe crime (like killing a dead cat serious). It has many forms.<br>
  <br> 
</p>
<h3>Verbatim Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Copy-pasting another’s work is regarded as one of the most clear-cut methods of plagiarizing. It is done to pass off another’s work as one’s own; it can be a part of a famous book or it can be another student’s work. All of these things are “serious copyright infringements”. This <img src="quote'y.jpg" width="199" height="165" align="right" />can include copying a phrase, or an entire passage. If you wish to give brief quote, give it in quote marks and clearly mention the source.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3>Paraphrasing and no Citations</h3>
<p>Even if you aren’t copy-pasting another’s work, and writing it in your own words, you still need to cite the source of the information, otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism. To avoid this form of the crime, you should write what you have to, from scratch and cite the sources in the end.<br><br>
</p>
<h3>Unclear References</h3>
<p>If you are putting a quote or piece of information in your work, you should cite the sources clearly enough for the reader to understand it easily. This does not in any way mean that you need to put the citation in the body of your work; you can also put the citation at the end of your work, in the footnotes or in the bibliography.<br><br>
</p>
<h3> <center> Ideas and Thoughts <center> <br>
</h3>
<p>The theft of another’s ideas, thoughts and mental works is considered as severe as copy-pasting from original works.  Even if you paraphrase it, it is still plagiarism. </p>
