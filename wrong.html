<h1> <center>Why is plagiarism wrong? </center> </h1>

<h3> <center> Why is plagiarism a crime? </center></h3> <br>
<p>Plagiarism is criminal as anyone who plagiarizes is pinching another's work and later, falsely claiming that it is their own. It means stealing another's intellectual property (thoughts and ideas) and so, like other forms of stealing, it is criminal. It is also criminal as it makes the examiner get a misconception about one’s abilities and stops one from being original and creative, and is thus a form of fraud. </p>

<h3><center> Why is plagiarism illegal? </center></h3> <br>
<p>Plagiarism is a breach of a law called the “intellectual property law”, which gives the creator of something original, exclusive rights to get profits from that work. Basically, plagiarism laws are subsistent only to safeguard the privileges of creators over their innovative work. </p>
