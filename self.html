  <p>Self Plagiarism<img src="sekd.jpg" width="62" height="107" align="middle" /></p>

<p>Self plagiarism is when a person reuses his/her own work again. That work may be a previously written article, a drawing,etc </p>
<h2>SO WHY IS IT WRONG?</h2>
<p> A point must be noted that even if you make a number of changes to a work of yours that you did in the past, the same work being submitted for a second time and getting credit twice is unfair. This actually means that you are asking for twice the appreciation for an assignment than it deserves. This is completely unfair and an academic offence. You are allowed to build on your previous work, but it is unfair to get credit twice for the same work. When you do so, you are not adding to your knowledge and it is harmful for you in the long run. Also, self-plagiarism is dishonest and goes against academic integrity.</p>
