              <p><strong>Dan Brown.</strong> The book in question was &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, which was not only a best seller but a highly successful film. Perdue felt that the distribution of these should be blocked. However, he lost in court. The presiding judge said &quot;The average lay observer would not conclude that &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is substantially similar to &quot;Daughter of God&quot;. Any slightly similar elements are on the level of generalised or otherwise unprotectable ideas.&quot;

                <strong>James Cameron.</strong> Harlan Ellison won his case against James Cameron/Orion Pictures for piracy of intellectual property. Although Cameron promoted his movie, &quot;The Terminator&quot;, as being inspired by a personal dream it actually was heavily based on two episodes Ellison wrote for &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. Ellison settled with Orion Pictures for $400,000 and story credit on the film after proving that an unadulterated Starlog article quoted Cameron as admitting that Ellison's &quot;Soldier&quot; and &quot;Demon With a Glass Hand&quot; were in fact the inspiration for &quot;The Terminator&quot;.

              <p><strong>George Harrison.</strong> The case (filed Feb. 10, 1971) involving the plagiarism of The Chiffon's song &quot;He's So Fine&quot; by George Harrison in his song &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; took years to resolve. Allegations centered on the similarity of the melody between the songs. Eventually, judgment was awarded by the court in favor of Bright Tunes Music Corporation, which owned the rights to the song. BELIEVE IT OR NOT - George Harrison's one time manager and advisor for the first phase of the plagiarism case was Allen Klein. After that first phase of the case was concluded Klein purchased Bright Tunes Music Corporation thereby becoming the plaintiff in the case! The final judgment in the case was that Harrison would purchase Bright Tunes Music Corporation from Klein for $587,000. However, this judgment was contested by Harrison, which resulted in ten more years of litigation with the end result being that the decision was upheld. A BIZARRE FOOTNOTE - In an effort to cash in on the notoriety of the plagiarism case the Chiffons recorded a rendition of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; in 1975.

                <strong>                T.S. Eliot.</strong> Rather than being shunned as a plagiarist, T. S. Eliot's thievery was considered by many as being an homage to other writers! In fact, &quot;The Wasteland&quot; is a modernist poem by Eliot consisting of little more than the stringing together of snippets gleaned from other writers' works. No wonder Eliot suffered from a nervous disorder as he must have been aware that there were plenty of writers that surely had little appreciation for his theft of their intellectual property.
